                <p>We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. A happy cloud. Just let these leaves jump off the brush You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Take your time. Speed will come later.</p>

                I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. It all happens automatically. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.

                This is unplanned it really just happens. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>
